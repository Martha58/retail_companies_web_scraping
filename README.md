# retail_companies_web_scraping

# Project Overview

In this project, I successfully developed a web scraping solution to extract data from a website listing retail companies operating in Nigeria. This project was commissioned by a client who required an organized dataset for further analysis and decision making.

The scope of the project involved identifying and extracting key information about the retail companies available on the site. Using efficient web scraping techniques, I navigated through the website's structure, located the target data, and ensured that the information was accurately retrieved without disrupting the website’s functionality.

Once the data was collected, I processed and formatted it to meet the client’s specific requirements. Finally, the information was saved into a .txt file, ensuring portability and ease of access for the client. This project highlights my expertise in web scraping, data processing, and delivering tailored solutions to meet client needs.
